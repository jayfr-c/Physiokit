Diabetes causes impairment in the body’s production of or sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that allows the cells to take and use glucose from the bloodstream for energy. This disruption to insulin makes it more difficult for the body to manage blood glucose levels.

When blood glucose remains permanently high, it impairs the function of white blood cells. White blood cells are central to the role of the immune system. 

People with uncontrolled diabetes may develop poor circulation. As circulation slows down, blood moves more slowly, which makes it more difficult for the body to deliver nutrients to wounds. As a result, the injuries heal slowly, or may not heal at all.

Diabetes can also cause neuropathy (nerve damage), which can also affect wound healing. Uncontrolled blood glucose can damage the nerves, numbing sensations in the area. This may mean that people with diabetes who sustain trauma to their feet might not be aware of the injury.

If a person is not aware of an injury, they might not receive treatment, which might allow the wound to worsen. A combination of slow healing and reduced sensation in the area significantly increases the risk of infection.

People with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing a bacterial infection in the wound.

Factors that may increase this risk include:

-impaired sweating
-dry and cracked skin
-toenail infections
-foot abnormalities, such as Charcot’s foot
-Other ways diabetes might affect wound healing include:

-reduced production of growth and healing hormones
-decreased production and repair of new blood vessels
-a weakened skin barrier
-reduced collagen production
