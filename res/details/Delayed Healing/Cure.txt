People with diabetes can use specific strategies to improve the time it takes for a wound to heal. These include managing blood glucose, through foot care, and treating wounds as they occur. 

WOUND TREATMENT 

It is essential that people with diabetes carefully monitor their wounds. While wounds might heal slowly, it is not normal for them to remain open for several weeks, to spread, ooze, or become extremely painful. 

GLUCOSE CONTROL

Lifestyle changes may even allow a person to manage diabetes without medication. 

People with bot type 1 and type 2 diabetes can benefit from a carbohydrate-controlled diet.
