INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE

Studies suggest that abdominal fat causes fat cells to
release ‘pro-inflammatory’ chemicals, which can make the 
body less sensitive to the insulin it produces by disrupting 
the function of insulin responsive cells and their ability 
to respond to insulin.

This is known as insulin resistance – the hallmark of type 2 diabetes.

Another theory put forward by scientists into how obesity could 
lead to type 2 diabetes is that obesity causes prediabetes, a 
metabolic condition that almost always develops into type 2 diabetes.
