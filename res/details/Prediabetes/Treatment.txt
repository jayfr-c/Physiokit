It is possible to prevent the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.

Changing your lifestyle to include healthier habits can help prevent progression to type 2 diabetes by decreasing your risk factors. Examples of healthy habits include:

A healthy diet low in simple carbohydrates like white bread can help prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. Doctors recommend focusing your diet around vegetables, whole grains, and healthy proteins. 

The CDC advises fitting in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, like walking, swimming, or cycling. 

If you are overweight, getting into a healthy weight range is the best way to treat prediabetes. The CDC says that losing just 5-7% of body weight can have a big impact.

Medication 

The medication metformin is commonly prescribed to treat prediabetes. Metformin helps your body process insulin and lower your blood sugar levels. However, metformin may not be suitable for some people, such as those with kidney problems. 

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a highly successful intervention program conducted in the US for 3,234 participants with prediabetes. In the study, published in the journal Diabetes Care in 2002, taking metformin alone reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 31%, and lifestyle changes alone, including weight loss and physical activity goals, reduced risk by 58%.
