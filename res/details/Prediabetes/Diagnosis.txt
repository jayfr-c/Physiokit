According to the CDC, there are several tests your doctor can use to find out if you have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes: 

A1C TEST
This test calculates your average blood sugar level over the course of 3 months. An A1C between 5.7 and 6.4% means you have prediabetes. 

FASTING BLOOD SUGAR TEST 
This test checks your blood sugar after not eating for eight hours (it's best to do it in the morning when you wake up). A blood sugar level of 100 to 125 mg/dL means you have prediabetes. 

GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST 
After fasting overnight, doctors will take your blood sugar level before and after consuming a sugary drink. After 2 hours, a blood sugar level of 140 to 199 mg/dL means you have prediabetes.
