The sources of distress might include the responsibilities of managing the condition and worrying about potential complications.

Some people with diabetes may feel stressed and powerlessness when trying to control their condition. Others may believe that they are not doing a good enough job in managing their diabetes.

Others may experience anxiety about whether their blood sugar is too high or too low or worry that they will not recognize low blood sugar quickly enough to avoid social embarrassment or danger if it occurs during sleep or while driving.

Some people become distressed by worrying about what a friend will think about their diabetes, or whether they will treat them differently. Family and friends may become overly involved and treat them as fragile or try to manage their diet or exercise for them.

Many people with diabetes also have concerns regarding their employers or the potential for employment.

Following a rigorous insulin schedule might disrupt a personâ€™s daily routine and trigger concerns about missing a dose, causing regimen distress.

The need to make dietary adjustments and check blood sugar regularly can also add to the stress and interrupt leisure and relaxation time, leading to further feelings of anxiety and depression.

Unpredictable elements may also cause anxiety and distress.
