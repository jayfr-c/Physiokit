We all get thirsty at various times during the day. Adequate daily 
intake of water (several glasses) is very important as water is 
essential for many bodily functions, including regulating body 
temperature and removing waste.

However, if you feel thirsty all the time or your thirst is stronger 
than usual and continues even after you drink, it can be a sign that 
not all is well inside your body.

Increased thirst in people with diabetes can sometimes be, but 
certainly not always, an indication of higher than normal blood 
glucose levels.
