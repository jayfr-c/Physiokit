Paresis occurs due to nerve damage, which can be caused by a 
variety of factors or conditions.

MONONEUROPATHY

Also called focal neuropathies, these are more common in people 
with diabetes and involve damage to a single nerve. It may affect 
the shoulder, hand, leg, feet or face and may be caused by pressure 
on a nerve. This can cause weakness, pain, numbness or even paralysis. 
Unlike diabetic neuropathies, which cannot be cured, mononeuropathy 
usually resolves with treatment.
