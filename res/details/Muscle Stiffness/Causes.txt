If diabetes damages nerves in your 
arms or legs, itâ€™s called diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 
This condition can be a direct result of long-term high 
blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) in those who have diabetes.

Peripheral neuropathy can also result in serious foot 
and leg conditions. Catching nerve damage early is important 
in preventing symptoms. This can help prevent lower leg amputations.
